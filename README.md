# flexspringbasicauth
Skeleton project setting up a REST spring mvc web application using spring security and Flex as client. 
Following the tutorial from http://www.codesandnotes.be/2015/07/24/angularjs-web-apps-for-spring-based-rest-services-security-the-server-side-part-2-csrf/ I provide a solution to remove completely Blazeds from your dependencies, so to be able to switch to newer version of java libraries and tools (JDK1.8, Tomcat 8) saving the client side exisiting code (with adjustments of course).
